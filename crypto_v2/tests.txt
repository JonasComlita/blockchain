## Notes

**Walled Garden Restrictions**: Your system has two key protection mechanisms:
1. $1.00 minimum transaction value
2. 50% maximum pool impact per swap

These are excellent defenses against:
- Micro-transaction spam
- Single-transaction pool draining
- MEV attacks with tiny test amounts

**Areas of Concern** (flagged for extra scrutiny):
1. **Reserve Pool Deploy Logic**: Only admin can deploy, but verify math is correct
2. **Outflow Reserve Pricing**: 98% of market price - verify this doesn't enable arbitrage
3. **Integer Division**: All `/` operations should be checked for precision loss
4. **Bonding Curve**: Verify BONDING_CURVE_SLOPE prevents runaway inflation

**Test Data Sets**:
- Create realistic transaction patterns (gaming app usage)
- Adversarial patterns (attacks)
- Edge cases (extreme values)
- Randomized fuzzing inputs
